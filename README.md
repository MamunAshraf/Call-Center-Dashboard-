In this project we will use a dataset from ‘Real World Fake Data’.
This project presents an interactive Call Center Performance Dashboard developed using a ‘Real World Fake Data’ dataset.
The dashboard helps management monitor agent productivity, customer satisfaction, call volumes, and service efficiency to support data-driven decision-making.
